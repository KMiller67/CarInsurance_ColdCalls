# CarInsurance_ColdCalls
Data Science project for predicting whether or not a client will purchase car insurance after a cold call campaign..

## Purpose
I've been learning quite a bit about topics related to data science and machine learning, including how to explore data and create models with Python. I decided to build this as a personal project to begin applying some of the things I've learned, as well as to investigate an interesting topic in general.

## Background
I wanted to begin with a more simple data set to make sure I had some basics down. I found a nice data set on Kaggle for the results of a cold call campaign from a bank that also offers car insurance to its clients. This topic was especially interesting to me as I have some prior experience in the insurance industry whereas I had to make many cold calls myself, and I was interested to see which features contributed more to determining the outcome of the cold call. The link to the details about the data set as posted on Kaggle is provided below:

A big thank you to Greg Kondla who posted the data set for public use and to the Decision Science and Systems Chair of Technical University of Munich (TUM) for gathering the original data from a real company. The files containing the data and a PDF with a more detailed explanation of the features within the data can be found at the provided link.
